How to Work with This System?
1) After the download exe file, click on that file and open it.
2) After the open file, you can see the application such as (Figure 01)
3) You should select the bottle colour, bottle size, bottle type, bottle cap, and other selection options.
4) After selection, you can submit your design.
5) If your design does not follow the design condition, the system gives the error message. (Figure 02)
6) Close that error message and click on the ‘Need Any Help’ option then read the designing condition. (Figure 4)
7) Re-fill the design form according to the design guidelines and submit it.
8) After your design is submitted, the system gives the message to you. (Figure 03)

FAQ & System Process.
1. What are the conditions of the selection process?
   • If the kids’ type is selected, the bottle cap should be kids-friendly.
   • If the Healthy Drinking Bottle, should select the Filter option.
3. What happens after Submitting the Preferred Design?
   • Selected design options pass to the next process of bottle manufacturing. That process works on another system part
